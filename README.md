# Inorganic Solids Bandgap Predictor

This project aims to predict the bandgap of inorganic solids using machine learning algorithms. It uses a Streamlit web application to provide a user-friendly interface for users to input data and visualize the results.

## Features

- Enter up to 100 inorganic material names.
- Select from Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, and Random Forest models.
- Choose the properties to consider for predicting the band gap.
- Upload input data in CSV or Excel format.
- Visualize the input data in bar plots.
- Display predicted bandgap values for each inorganic material.

## Installation

To use this project, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your system. Additionally, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- Streamlit
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

#Usage
To run the Streamlit application, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:
"
streamlit run app.py
"
This will open the application in your default web browser.
